In this image, I have conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) where I visualized the data by plotting graphs for both the test and train datasets. This step provides a deeper understanding of the data distribution, patterns, and potential insights setting the stage for more advanced modeling and analysis.

I have illustrated box plots for the dataset providing a visual summary of the data distribution and identifying any potential outliers. Through this analysis I gained valuable insights into the underlying patterns and trends within the data which will guide the subsequent stages of analysis and model development.

I have created subplots for the dataset, allowing for a more detailed and comparative analysis of different variables. By breaking down the data into these smaller visual components, I was able to examine specific relationships and trends more closely, leading to a deeper understanding of the dataset as a whole.

I trained a model using the Random Forest classifier to predict loan eligibility, determining whether an individual qualifies for a loan based on the input features. This approach enhances prediction accuracy by considering multiple decision trees, ensuring a more reliable outcome.
